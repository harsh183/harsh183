### Henlo

I'm a student at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/) studying [Statistcs and Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science). I like full stack web development, human computer interaction, gaze based interaction, teaching programming, distributed systems, and making my work available to the public.

##### Hire 

I'm looking for Software Engineering Opportunities after I graduate in **May 2022**. Feel free to message me via email at harsh.deep.3984@gmail.com or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh183/). I'm interested in Full Stack Web Development and Data Science/Machine Learning roles as well as anything leaning towards Automation. I also have past relevant experience in Backend Development and Accessibility.

##### Mentor/Advice

Feel free to email me if you're looking for advice with getting started with software, navigating higher education in the US or anything else you think I can help with. I'm very happy to talk to people and help them out.

##### Teaching Experience

I've spent multiple semesters having pivotal roles teaching various introductory computer science resources at UIUC like [CS 125](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/) -  Introduction to Computer Science, [CS 199: IKP](https://kotlin.cs.illinois.edu/) - Intro to Kotlin Programming, and [CS 199: EMP](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/) - Even More Programming. This summer I'm leading a series of workshops and guided projects with [CS 125 - Summer of Side Projects](125summer.tech/).
