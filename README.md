### Henlo

I'm a student at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/) studying [Statistics & Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science). I like full stack web development, human computer interaction, gaze based interaction, teaching programming, distributed systems, and making my work available to the public. I'm starting out as a Software Engineer at [Modern Treasury](https://www.moderntreasury.com/) soon!

##### Mentor/Advice

Feel free to email me if you're looking for advice with getting started with software, navigating higher education in the US or anything else you think I can help with. I'm very happy to talk to people and help them out.
